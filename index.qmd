Ersatz Production is a production company (association) based in Fribourg, Switzerland.

It was founded in 2024 by four people from different professional backgrounds, but united by a common desire: **Going Beyond Established Frameworks**.

Whether documentary or fiction films - short, medium or feature-length - TV or web series, podcasts, music or live art, our aim is to promote and create audiovisual works with cross-media approach ambitions, while supporting bold and innovative artists.
