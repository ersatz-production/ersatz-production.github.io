And when the day winds down, he's all about gaming into the wee hours of the night.\nThe discovery of new experiences and impressions through diverse art forms and media is what interests Rani and what he wishes to convey through his own works.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card-footer\">\n<a href=\"https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/person/gillioz-rani/320F8A74646E41718A8CB4BD0C32B79A\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">www.swissfilms.ch</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"g-col-12 g-col-md-6 g-col-xl-4\">\n<div class=\"card h-100\">\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-lettry-a4ab81259/?originalSubdomain=ch\"><img src=\"image/vincent_profile.jpg\"alt = \"An avatar of a blond man.\"class=\"card-img-top\"></a>\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n<h2 class=\"card-title\">Vincent</h2>\n<h3 class=\"card-subtitle\">Communication & Creation</h3>\n<p class=\"card-text\">Meet Vincent, our resident storyteller. \n  His love for spinning tales began long ago, first as an English and History teacher, where he wove narratives into every lesson.
