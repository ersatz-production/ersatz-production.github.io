He now works as a freelance translator and spends his free time creating music - or noise - on the piano or computer, playing video games late into the night, and immersing himself in literature and philosophy. He is particularly interested in discovering new experiences and impressions through various forms of art and media, and wishes to convey this through his own work.\n\nView Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent\n\n\nPresident & Creator\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Vincent, our storyteller.
